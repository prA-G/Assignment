    "What is Detectron2 and how does it differ from previous object detection frameworks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Detectron2 is an open-source computer vision framework developed by Facebook AI\n",
    "Research. It is built on PyTorch and is used for tasks like object detection,\n",
    "instance segmentation, and keypoint detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detectron2 differs from older object detection frameworks in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is based on PyTorch, which makes model development and debugging easier.\n",
    "- It has a modular and flexible design, allowing easy customization.\n",
    "- It provides better performance and speed compared to older frameworks like\n",
    "  Detectron (Caffe2-based).\n",
    "- It supports modern and state-of-the-art detection models.\n",
    "- It includes built-in evaluation and visualization tools.\n",

    "Explain the process and importance of data annotation when working with Detectron2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Data annotation is the process of labeling objects in images so that a model can\n",
    "learn to recognize them. In Detectron2, annotations usually include bounding\n",
    "boxes, class labels, and sometimes segmentation masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves:\n",
    "- Collecting images\n",
    "- Labeling objects using annotation tools\n",
    "- Saving annotations in formats like COCO\n",
    "- Loading the annotated data into Detectron2 for training\n",
    "\n",
    "Data annotation is important because:\n",
    "- The model learns only from labeled data\n",
    "- Accurate annotations improve model accuracy\n",
    "- Poor or incorrect labels lead to wrong predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, good data annotation is the foundation of training an effective\n",
